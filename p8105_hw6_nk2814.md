#### Problem 1

``` r
# Import and clean birthweight data for regression analysis
# outcome = bwt

# Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).


birthweight =
  read.csv("birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    bwt = bwt/453.592   
  ) 
```
