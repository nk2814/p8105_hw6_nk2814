#### Problem 1

``` r
# Import and clean birthweight data for regression analysis
# outcome = bwt

# Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).


birthweight =
  read.csv("birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    bwt = bwt/453.592   
  ) 

# Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values â€“ use add_predictions and add_residuals in making this plot.


# First, fit a preliminary simple linear regression model, regressing maternal pre-pregnancy weight (lbs) on birthweight (lbs)

fit1 = lm(bwt ~ ppwt, data = birthweight) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) 
```
